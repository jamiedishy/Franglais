Problem: Help Anglophones navigate Quebec society given their language barrier. 
         Take into account that about 94% of the Quebec population from 2011 could carry conversation in French.

Solution: Franglais is your personal translator to learn French fast and effectively. 
          Rather than manually searching for terms and potentially mispronouncing words, speak to Franglais, your personal translator, 
          that takes your English statements and translates them automatically to French, and vice versa.
